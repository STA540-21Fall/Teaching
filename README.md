### Project 1

#### Week 1 (Aug 26): Study & Planning ([Lecture](/Lectures/Lecture%201.pdf))

- Read project discription, identify potential topics of interest.
- Discuss as a team about the topics (interest, difficulty, data accessibility, etc).
- Collect and tidy data that might be needed for your topic.

#### Week 2 (Sep 2) Design & Development

- Build statistical models to get insight and findings that you want to present.
- Learn about R shiny and start with simple projects.
- Design the visuals for R shiny app - how the design would be attractive and useful to assist your presentation?
- While you are working on statistical models, you might start programming for R shiny using fake/simulated data.

#### Week 3 (Sep 9) Implementation & Presentation

- Finalize the R shiny app and polish your report.
- Prepare to present in class.
